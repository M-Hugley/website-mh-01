# **Convert 12 hour time to 24 hour time(military time)**

## Blog: 1 Date: 12/27/2020

### Welcome, Firstly I am gonna be talking about why I am making this then I will talk about the actual process. Also this is how I personally convert time.

I am making this cause of these reasons.
1. I told someone I was gonna write about this.
2. I think military time is overall better cause you do not have to clarify PM or AM so there is no confusion.
3. It Is easy to convert to 12 hour time and vice-versa (for me personally).
4. People ask and I would rather give them a link or read from this page then reamber on the spot.
5. Future reference.

To convert 12 hour time to 24 hour time add the hour and 12.
A example is 5PM, because we add the hour which in this case is 5, we do simple math.
Which would be 5+12=17:00.
Now here is how to convert that to 12 hour style:
Now that we have the military time we can just minus 2 hours and ignore the 1.
So to convert it back it would be 17-2=15 so now we just remove the one and we get 5 which we would know is PM cause it is past 12:59.

To convert 24 hour to 12 hour you just subtract 12 hours.
So for example 21:00 minus 10 so it would be 11:00 then subtract 2 hours and it would be 9 and we would know it is PM cause it was above 12:59.
This is how you convert it back to military time:
If the time was 9PM you could add the hour which would be 9 in this case then 12.
So it would be 9+12=21:00.

### Bonus tip

After a while I personally dont really need to do much math cause for example if military time is 23:00
I just subtract 2 to the hour so it would then be 21:00 so I know that is 11PM cause I just ignore the 2 and replace it with a 1.
The reason for that is the 12 hour clock only goes to a maximum of 12 when in double digits so I know the first digit in a double digit segment wont be a 2 on 12 hour time.
