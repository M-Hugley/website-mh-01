Also this is how I personally convert time.</h3>
    <p>I am making this cause of these reasons.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I told someone I was gonna write about this.</li>
      <li>I think military time is overall better cause you do not have to clarify PM or AM so there is no confusion.</li>
      <li>It Is easy to convert to 12 hour time and vice-versa (for me personally).</li>
      <li>People ask and I would rather give them a link or read from this page then reamber on the spot.</li>
      <li>Future reference.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To convert 12 hour time to 24 hour time add the hour and 12.
A example is 5PM, because we add the hour which in this case is 5, we do simple math.
Which would be 5+12=17:00.
Now here is how to convert that to 12 hour style:
Now that we have the military time we can just minus 2 hours and ignore the 1.
So to convert it back it would be 17-2=15 so now we just remove the one and we get 5 which we would know is PM cause it is past 12:59.</p>
    <p>To convert 24 hour to 12 hour you just subtract 12 hours.
So for example 21:00 minus 10 so it would be 11:00 then subtract 2 hours and it would be 9 and we would know it is PM cause it was above 12:59.
This is how you convert it back to military time:
If the time was 9PM you could add the hour which would be 9 in this case then 12.
So it would be 9+12=21:00.</p>
    <h3 id="bonus-tip">Bonus tip</h3>
    <p>After a while I personally dont really need to do much math cause for example if military time is 23:00
I just subtract 2 to the hour so it would then be 21:00 so I know that is 11PM cause I just ignore the 2 and replace it with a 1.
The reason for that is the 12 hour clock only goes to a maximum of 12 when in double digits so I know the first digit in a double digit segment wont be a 2 on 12 hour time.</p>
