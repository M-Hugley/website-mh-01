### **█**

If you are here then you clicked on "[█](./█.html)" which is a "[Block Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements)" specifically the "[Full block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements#Character_table)" and it can be written using alt codes it is 219 according to a alt codes [website](https://www.alt-codes.net/)

When some form of text is replaced with "█" most of the time it is something that is Not for publication, Not made public. Sometimes it might be temporary for me to add later.
