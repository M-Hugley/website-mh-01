### **█**

If you are here then you clicked on "[█](./█.html)" which is a "[Block Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements)" specifically the "[Full block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements#Character_table)" and it can be written using alt codes it is 219 according to a alt codes [website](https://www.alt-codes.net/)

When some form of text is replaced with "█" most of the time it is something that is Not for publication, Not made public. Sometimes it might be temporary for me to add later. Sometimes it might stay undisclosed for ever or for a certain amount of time. Or it could be confidential(unlikely) or restrictied.
