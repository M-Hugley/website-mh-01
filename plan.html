	<!--Below is the content of the page.-->
    <p>Some of my plan I originally talked about on the <a href="about-me.html">about me page</a>. Originally I was hoping to get that certifcation before finishing <a href="./%E2%96%88.html">██████</a> and then I was gonna focus more time into the business. Now my plan is finish <a href="./%E2%96%88.html">██████ ███ ████ █████</a> and look into the military. I have decided that personally for me navy is the best option. What I want to do in the navy is not completly decided yet.</p>
